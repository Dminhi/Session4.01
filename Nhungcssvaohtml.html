            With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images of background color are to be used, different displays for different deveces and screen size, and
            much more!

            <b>Tip:</b> The word <b>cascading</b> means that style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, pragraphs, and other text elements
            within the boby will also get the same color (unless you specily something else)!
